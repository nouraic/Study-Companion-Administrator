# Study-Companion-Administrator
This website is for Merrimack College Administration to monitor and upload to the back end of the Study Companion app and website

This website is structurded via tabs therefore most of the code is done in Admin.html, looking back at this project, I would not use a tab layout agaun, rather I would create different pages for each section of the website. 

This website uses the same Google Firebase Database as the Study Companion mobile application.

Languages used in this website: Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, PHP
